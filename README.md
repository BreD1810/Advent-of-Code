# Advent of Code
## 2017
I chose to use Java as I was starting to learn the language at University.

## 2018
I chose to use Python as Java seemed to be a bit "heavy" for small scripts. Python is also a language that I was planning to learn at the time, so it appeared to be a good choice to improve my skills with the language.

## 2021
Learning Go!
